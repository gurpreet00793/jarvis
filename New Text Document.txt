strings:

strings can be created by enclosing characters inside a single quote or double quotes. even triple quotes can be used in python but generally used to represent multiline strings and docstrings .

ex:
#all of the following are equivalent 
my_strings ='hello'
print(my_string)

my_string="hello"
print(my_string)

my_string='''hello'''
print(my_string)

#triple quotes string can be extend multiple lines 
my_string="""hello,welcome to 
            the world of python"""
print(my_string)

the index of -1 refers to the last item,-2to the secomd last item and so on.we can access a range of items in a string by using the slicing operator(colon).

ex:-
str='programiz'
print('str=',str)

#first character
print('str[0]=',str[0])

#last character
print(str[-1]=',str[-1])

#slicing 2nd to 5th character
print('str[1:5]='str[1:5])

#slicing 6th to 2nd last character
print('str[5:-2]=',str[5:-2])


slicing is done in the way given below

P  Y  T  H  O  N
0  1  2  3  4  5
-6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1


Strings are immutable.this means that element of a string cannot be changed once it has assigned .we can simply re assign differnet strings to the same name.

ex:-
my_string="python"
my_string[4]="a"

#o/p
Type error:'str'object does not support item assignment

we cannot delete or remove characters from a string.
but deleting the string entirely is possible using the keyboard del.

ex:-
del my string[1]
o/p:-type error:'str' object doesn't support item deletion.

ex:-
my_string="welcome to python"
del my_string
print(my_string)
o/p:-Nameeroor: name'my string'is not defned
