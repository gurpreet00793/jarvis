operators:-

operators are special symbols in python that carry out arthimatic and logical computations.the value that the operator operate is called operand.

python divides the operators in following types:-
1.arthimatic operations
2.assignment operators
3.comparison operator
4.logical operator
5.identity operator
6.membership operator
7.bitwise operator

1.arthimatic operator= +,-,*,/, modulus=x%y , floor division- if the divided value comes in point it will remove the value behind points like 2.30=2

eg.
a=21
b=10
c=0

c=a+b

print("value of a is",a)
print("value of b is",b)
print("value of c is",c)

c=a%b
print("value of c is",c)

a=2
b=3
c=a**b
print("value of c",c)

a=10
b=3
c=a//b
print("value of c",c)

2.assingnment operator

they are used in python to assign the value   to variable

c=a+b 

+=add and

-= it subracts right operand to left operand and stores the value in left operand 

*= it multiply right operand with left operand and assign the value to left operand

/= [c/=0 is equal to c=c/a]

%= [c%=a is equal to c=c%a]


**= [c**=a is equal to c=c**a]

//=[c//=a is equal to c=c//a]

AND OPERATOR->  $= [x$=5 is equal to x=x$5]

OR OPERATOR->   |=[x|=5 is equal to x=x|5]

XOR OPERATOR->  ^=[x^=5 is equal to x=x^5]

RIGHT SHIFT->   >>=[x>>=5 is equal to x=x>>5]

LEFT SHIFT->    <<=[x<<5 is equal to x=x<<5]
